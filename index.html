					Part of Africaâ€™s new generation of creatives, <br>
					Moses Turahirwa is on a mission to usher in a new era of slow,<br>
					thoughtful fashion. His Moshions brand is an ever-evolving creative manifestation <br>

					tradition found in Rwanda and across the African continent.<br>
					Through innovative design that often includes meticulous craftsmanship and manual printing <br>
					techniques,<br>
					Moses reinterprets continental heritage through contemporary fashion, <br>
					thrilled by the opportunity to celebrate Africa vibrant narratives with the world.</p>
